# Minimum-Variance-Portfolio-Strategy
My first data science project that I would consider as advanced. Using L1 LASSO and L2 Ridge constraints in modelling our linear regression, we aim to find a slope that minimizes the variance between all assets in a portfolio. This makes the basis of our Minimum Portfolio Strategy, we then perform hyperparameter tuning to optimise Sharpe Ratios.
